"Happiness is love, nothing else. A man who is capable of love is happy." Hermann Hesse.
THE EVIDENCE OF INTERSPECIES communication and the fundamental beingness of nonhumans is so obvious 
as to render my previous skepticism embarrassing. To attempt a proof that non-humans communicate would 
not only be degrading imagine a book purporting to prove that blondes can think it would he silly, 
like proving the existence of gravity, love, death, or physical existence. It could be written in two 
words pay attention or better, in one listen. One evening last spring I sat on the couch, looking out 
the window and talking on the phone. The lights were off, inside and out. The window was open. It was that 
time of day when shapes lose distinct edges, when solid shadows blur into back ground.
