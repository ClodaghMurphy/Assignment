#4 collatz
#Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer 
#and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. 
#At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and,
#if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. 
#Have the program end if the current value is one.

#The instructions provided above refer to the collatz conjecture, this is
#an unsolved mathematical problem at time of writing.
#No matter what number selected, the final result will always be one.
#This code can be used to test the theory and if you get a result other than one
#I'd be happy to take a cut of the $500 reward ; P


#while i != 1:
#    if i%2 == 0: print(i//2)
#no need to write code for both i%2==0 and i%2==1 
#If one is true, the other is automatically false
# Boolean innit?
#    else:
#        print(i*3+1)

#13032019 as this code currently stands the loop isn't happening as desired.
#It just goes on an infinite loop.
#i need to make the loop a function as per week 6 programming video
#then feed the input into it

x = int(input("Hello. Please input a positive whole number. "))
#firstly ask the user to input a positive integer i.e. a whole number.


# Tell the user it must be a positive integer if it is not one

while x <= 0:
    print("I require a positive whole number. Please run the program again.")
    exit()
# Use the exit() method to stop the program running. 
# It is the most reliable, cross-platform way of stopping code execution
