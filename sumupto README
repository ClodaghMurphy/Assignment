## Project title  Problem Set 2019 Programming and Scripting 

## Project 1. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one 
and that number.

## Motivation

This project represents 50% of the marks due for Programming and Scripting Module 10 Credits.  
Each problem therefore is worth 5% of the overall mark!

## Code style

The coding is written in Python, which, according to DM's i-Tech Special | Coding for Beginners Volume 29 is
"the greatest computer programming language ever created".  

##Background

I began working on this Problem Set before I was familiar with version control software git.  
It is the first program I have written and relied on somewhat analogue methods while I learned more about coding 
and the online resources that can assist.  

##Methodology

Using a pen and paper, I tried to figure out a maths equation that would give me the sum of all numbers. 
This was to no avail so I started to google then came upon a formula by Gauss, a mathematician in the 18th Century.
n = n * (n + 1) / 2 
I wrote the code which would apply this formula to whatever positive integer was input.
I inserted a while statement intended to reject a number that wasn't a positive integer.
During testing, it became apparent that a request for a positive whole number would print on the screen, however the formula would 
still run on the number that was originally input.
I debugged the code by using the exit() command that simply closes the program if the condition of a positive integer is not met.
A line of text instructs the user to run the program again which ensures the results will be based on a positive integer.
