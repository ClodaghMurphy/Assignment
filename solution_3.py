#Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 
# that are divisible by 6 but not 12 
#Clodagh Murphy 2019 02 10

#If iteration over a sequence of numbers is required, 
#the built-in function range() comes in handy. 
#It generates arithmetic progressions.

for i in range (1000, 1100):
    if  (i % 12 == 0):
    if  (i % 6 == 0):

        print (i)
    

#while a < 1000:
#print(a, end=',')

#continue
#and and (i % 12 == 1 
# #(i % 6 == 0)  
# print (i, "is divisible by 6 but not 12")       

#print("Have a nice day!")
